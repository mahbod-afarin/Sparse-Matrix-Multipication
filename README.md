# Sparse-Matrix-Multipication

The goal of this project is to improve the performance of the sparse matrix-vector multiplication using OpenMP. The is 4 implementations in the project folder, CSRSeq.c, CSROpenMP.c, CSCSeq.c, and CSCOpenMP.c. You can run each code using the below command. For running the program, please use the input files in the project because, as it was allowed in piazza, I changed the format of the input files from .rtf format to .text format. You can find the report of this project [here](https://github.com/mahbod-art/Sparse-Matrix-Multipication/blob/main/Report.pdf).
